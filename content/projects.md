I mainly work on my startup, [Chroma](trychroma.com).

Some other things I made include:

- [MathLLM](https://github.com/atroyn/math-llm), a [very simple agent](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1669111409727410176?s=20) which lets large language models ground their mathematical reasoning using a software proof assistant.
- [Bay Area Bed Frame Grants](https://twitter.com/atroyn/status/1577082586337226752?s=20), a grant to give people in the bay area bed frames so they don't sleep on the floor.

My previous blog / personal site can be found in various incarnations [on the internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/troynikov.io).
